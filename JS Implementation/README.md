# Setting Up

I have to assume that you have npm and git installed and so in order to get started first copy the repository over to your local machine. Inside the root directory of the project as administrator run:
```js
npm install
```
This will handle the installation of all node_modules.


# Changing the Input

Inside of input.txt you will find the three lines that correspond to the angle, axis of rotation, and vector. 


# Expected Output

The output will always be up to 5 decimal places.


# Running the Code

Inside of index.js change the parameters as you see fit and inside a command prompt simply run:
```js
node index.js
```
