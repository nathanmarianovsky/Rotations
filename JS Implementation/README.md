# Setting Up
I have to assume that you have npm and git installed and so in order to get started first copy the repository over to your local machine. Inside the root directory of the project as administrator run:
```js
npm install
```
This will handle the installation of all node_modules.

# Running Code
Inside of app.js change the parameters as you see fit and inside a command prompt simply run:
```js
node app.js
```
