<h1 align="center">Rotations</h1>

This is a collection of documents I wrote up for an independent study class I was sitting in on to provide mathematical frameworks for different rotations in three dimensional space. Under "Quaternions" I discuss what a quaternion is and how it can be used to formulate a mapping that is exactly a rotation. "Euler Angles" provide a systematic way to define three angles that can then be used to perform a rotation about a specified set of axes.
