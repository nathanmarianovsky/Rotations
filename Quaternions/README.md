<h1 align="center">Rotations & Quaternions</h1>

This is a document I wrote up for an independent study class I was sitting in on to provide:
- A quick crash course on groups with some examples (specifically ones pertaining to matrices)
- An introduction to quaternions and some of their properties
- An introduction to rotations with:
  - A derivation of Rodrigues' Rotation Formula
  - A derivation of rotations using quaternions
